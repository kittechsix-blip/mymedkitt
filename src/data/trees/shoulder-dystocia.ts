    body: '[Shoulder Dystocia Steps Summary](#/info/sd-summary) — quick-reference escalation checklist to review before delivery.\n\n**Shoulder dystocia occurs when the baby\'s anterior shoulder becomes impacted behind the mother\'s pubic symphysis after delivery of the fetal head.** The remainder of the baby does not follow the head as it usually does during vaginal delivery.\n\nKEY FACTS\n• Cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy [1]\n• Cannot be prevented by any specific strategies or maneuvers [1]\n• Occurs in approximately 1.5% of vaginal deliveries [9]\n\nTWO SIGNS OF SHOULDER DYSTOCIA\n**1. Failure to deliver** — The baby\'s body does not emerge with standard traction and maternal pushing after delivery of the fetal head.\n\n**2. The "Turtle Sign"** — The fetal head suddenly retracts back against the mother\'s perineum after emerging from the vagina. The baby\'s cheeks bulge out, resembling a turtle pulling its head back into its shell. This retraction is caused by the anterior shoulder catching on the posterior surface of the maternal pubic bone.',

[2][3]\n\n• Wood (1973): fetal pH drops ~0.04 units per minute during shoulder dystocia [4]\n• Leung (2011): pH drop ~0.01 units per minute; 4–5 min before ischemic neuropathy risk [2]\n• This time frame depends on the oxygenation and acidosis status of the fetus prior to onset\n\nDO NOT PANIC\nBy restraining panic, keeping a cool head, and employing a previously thought-out set of maneuvers, almost all shoulder dystocias can be resolved with excellent results.

This is standard of care practiced by obstetricians across the United States and described in major obstetrical textbooks (Williams Obstetrics, Stanford Handbook). [1]\n\nAXIAL TRACTION\nPer ACOG (2014): because the infant\'s position within the pelvis is at some angle relative to the horizontal plane, **axial traction is generally applied in the direction below the horizontal plane** (downward axial traction). This is distinguished from downward lateral traction or lateral bending. [1]\n\nON "EXCESSIVE FORCE"\nSome investigators (Allen 1991, Gonik) have attempted to quantify "excessive force" using piezoelectric fingertip sensors. There is no universally accepted threshold. [12]\n\nWhen all maneuvers have been exhausted and the only options are maximal extraction effort, hypoxic neurologic damage, or fetal death — **the risk of brachial plexus or other injury must be accepted** to save the baby\'s life.

    title: 'Delivery of the Posterior Arm — MOST RELIABLE Maneuver',
    body: '**⭐ MOST RELIABLE MANEUVER FOR RESOLVING SHOULDER DYSTOCIA.**\n\nIn the NICHD Consortium on Safe Labor analysis (Hoffman 2011), delivery of the posterior arm had the **highest single-maneuver success rate of ANY shoulder dystocia maneuver — 84.4%** — far exceeding McRoberts (24.3%), suprapubic pressure (28.5%), or rotational maneuvers (~54%). [9] Poggi (2003) and Chauhan (2010) argue it should be prioritized earlier in the sequence, not reserved as a "last resort." [20][21]\n\n**Also known as:** Schwartz maneuver (US) · Jacquemier\'s maneuver (France)\n\n**WHY IT IS THE MOST RELIABLE**\n• **Mechanically decisive** — converts a bisacromial impaction (shoulder-to-shoulder) into a smaller bi-arm delivery; removing the posterior arm reduces the effective shoulder girdle diameter by ~20%\n• **Independent of maternal anatomy** — unlike McRoberts, does not rely on pelvic angle change\n• **Independent of fetal rotation** — unlike Woods/Rubin, does not require the fetus to rotate\n• **Directly addresses the obstruction** — once the posterior arm is out, the anterior shoulder typically releases passively\n\n**TECHNIQUE — STEP BY STEP**\n\n**1. POSITION & ACCESS**\n• Reach along the **posterior vaginal wall** — the sacral hollow provides the most room\n• Use the hand corresponding to the fetal ventral surface (if fetus is OA, reach with hand matching fetal chest)\n• Generous episiotomy may aid access but is NOT routinely required [18]\n\n**2. LOCATE THE POSTERIOR ARM**\n• Trace the posterior shoulder down to the elbow\n• Identify the **antecubital fossa** (anterior surface of the elbow)\n\n**3. FLEX THE ELBOW**\n• Apply firm pressure to the antecubital fossa\n• This flexes the forearm across the fetal chest\n• **DO NOT pull on the upper arm** — humeral fracture risk is much higher with upper-arm traction\n\n**4. GRASP THE FOREARM OR WRIST**\n• Slide fingers down the flexed forearm\n• Grasp the **forearm or wrist only** — never the upper arm (humerus)\n\n**5. SWEEP ACROSS THE CHEST**\n• "Wipe" the arm across the fetal chest in an arc — **NOT straight downward**\n• Deliver the fetal hand first, followed by the forearm and shoulder\n• Removing the posterior arm reduces the bisacromial diameter → the anterior shoulder typically releases\n\n**6. IF ANTERIOR SHOULDER STILL IMPACTED**\n• Rotate the baby 180° so the delivered posterior shoulder becomes anterior\n• Complete delivery as a normal vaginal delivery\n\n**MENTICOGLOU MODIFICATION — Axillary Traction (2006)** [19]\n**Use when the posterior arm cannot be reached** (fully extended above fetal head, severe macrosomia, inadequate room).\n• Hook **index and middle fingers** in the posterior axilla (armpit)\n• Apply **gentle traction along the long axis of the humerus** — deliver the posterior shoulder first\n• Once the shoulder clears the pelvis, the arm becomes accessible and can be swept out as above\n• Menticoglou reported 100% success in 6 consecutive severe shoulder dystocias where conventional posterior arm delivery had failed [19]\n\n**RISKS**\n• **Humeral fracture:** ~4% with proper forearm grasp technique; 12.4% in older Gherman series (upper-arm traction, different era) [11]\n• Almost all humeral fractures heal completely with simple immobilization — **acceptable trade-off in a life-threatening delivery**\n• Brachial plexus injury rate: similar to other maneuvers — no increase specifically from posterior arm delivery [13]\n• Gurewitsch (2005): posterior arm delivery may place **LESS** stretch on the brachial plexus than continued traction during failed rotational attempts [10]\n\n**EVIDENCE COMPARISON**\n• **Hoffman 2011 (NICHD Consortium on Safe Labor):** 84.4% single-maneuver delivery rate — highest of any individual maneuver. No difference in neonatal injury rates. [9]\n• **Poggi 2003:** Case series advocating prioritization of posterior arm delivery in severe shoulder dystocia. [20]\n• **Chauhan 2010:** Argues posterior arm delivery should be moved earlier in the maneuver sequence based on comparative success data. [21]\n• **Leung 2011:** Rotational vs posterior arm had similar success; posterior arm had higher reported injury (21% vs 4.4%) — but this includes self-limited humeral fractures that heal without sequelae. [2]\n• **Spain 2015:** After adjusting for duration and severity, NO individual maneuver was independently associated with neonatal morbidity — "use the maneuver most likely to result in successful delivery." [13]\n\n**BOTTOM LINE:** If McRoberts + suprapubic pressure fails, consider going directly to posterior arm delivery rather than attempting multiple rotational maneuvers first. The evidence increasingly supports this approach.',
