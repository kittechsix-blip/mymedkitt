Aspirate — dark blood confirms placement in fracture hematoma. Inject 5–10 mL of 1% plain lidocaine. Wait 5–10 minutes for full effect. [3][6]\n\n**Ultrasound guidance:** Real-time visualization of needle entering fracture gap improves accuracy, reduces pain during injection, and may improve block success. Particularly valuable in pediatric patients and those with difficult anatomy. [5][7][8]\n\n**Combined fractures:** For radius + ulna, a second injection into the ulnar fracture hematoma is required for complete analgesia. [6]',

Systemic absorption is rapid, similar to intraosseous (IO) administration. Respect weight-based dosing limits strictly.

Mean pain scores were acceptable (VAS 3.2 during reduction). [4]\n\n**No NPO requirement:** Hematoma block does not require fasting assessment, dedicated monitoring nurse, or capnography — reducing resource utilization significantly.

(2025) found US-guided nerve blocks achieved 94% first-attempt reduction success vs 74% for hematoma block, with lower pain scores during reduction. However, nerve blocks required ultrasound proficiency and additional setup time. [12]\n\n**Axillary block comparison:** Rook et al. (2025) demonstrated superior analgesia with US-guided axillary nerve block vs hematoma block, but at the cost of longer preparation and higher technical skill requirements. [13]\n\n**Cochrane review:** Handoll et al. (2002) found insufficient evidence to definitively recommend one anesthesia technique over another for distal radius reduction. Choice should be based on clinician skill, available resources, and patient factors. [9]\n\n**Regional vs hematoma meta-analysis:** Guirguis et al.
